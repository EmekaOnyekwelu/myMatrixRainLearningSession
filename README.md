# myMatrixRainLearningSession
Follow through with Emily Xies' walk through of Matrix Rain using P5.js
Using P5.js web editor. A learning journey especially with the keyword 'new' and the 'smbol' constructor. 
Eventually used the class 'coin' to skip 'symbol'. Still digging through material to get some insights on 'symbol' and constructor principles in general. 
Intend to have several 'passes' as i play and tweak the project.
